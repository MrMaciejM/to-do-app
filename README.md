## To-Do App

For this class task we have been asked to build a to-do app from scratch.
The app must meet several criteria, such as persistent data after refreshing the page, deleting all items, deleting items individually, adding items, etc.

Since this is a small class task, I am working on this app in my free time outside of class, so commits will be irregular and there is no deadline for this. Most of my time is being allocated to studying and preparing for building apps from module tests that will be marked.
